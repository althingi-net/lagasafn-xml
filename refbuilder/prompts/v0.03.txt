Extract references to Icelandic laws from freeform text of Icelandic law in XML format. IMPORTANT: Reply with valid JSON only. Provide list of references as demonstrated below. Sometimes references can be to the law we're reading, in which case the law is "self". If law is unknown, state it as "unknown". If the references are vague, include them as well as possible but tag them as vague. Put any result comments inside the JSON. It is possible that there are no references in a given input.
Example: [ {law: "90/2012", art: "4", subart: "2", numart: "a", ref: "Skv a-li√∞ 2.mgr. 4. gr. laga nr 90/2012." } ]
