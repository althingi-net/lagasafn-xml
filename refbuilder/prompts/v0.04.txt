Extract references to Icelandic laws from freeform text of Icelandic law in XML format. 
IMPORTANT: Reply with valid JSON only. 
Provide list of references as demonstrated below. 
It is possible that there are no references in a given input.
References can be to the law we're reading, in which case the law is "self". 
If law is unknown, state it as "unknown". 
If the references are vague, mark them as vague but include all possible details. 
Put any result comments inside the JSON. 
Example: 
[ 
  {law: "90/2012", art: "4", subart: "2", numart: "a", ref: "Skv a-lið 2.mgr. 4. gr. laga nr 90/2012." },
  {law: "33/1944", art: "27", subart: "6", ref: "Skv 6.mgr. 27. gr. laga nr 33/1944." },
